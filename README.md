| [Dockerfile](https://github.com/FaresAmiar/Airbnb-Price-Prediction/blob/main/Dockerfile)             | This code sets up a Python environment, installs the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt, copies project files and data into a working directory, and runs the runner.py script for managing workflows. |
| [Makefile](https://github.com/FaresAmiar/Airbnb-Price-Prediction/blob/main/Makefile)                 | This Makefile provides commands for starting MLflow, Prefect Server, and Prefect Agent, as well as running a Python script. It also includes a help message and an additional target for other actions.              |
| [start_mlflow.bat](https://github.com/FaresAmiar/Airbnb-Price-Prediction/blob/main/start_mlflow.bat) | This command starts an MLflow server with specified host, port, backend store, and default artifact root configurations.                                                                                             |
| [killakill.bat](https://github.com/FaresAmiar/Airbnb-Price-Prediction/blob/main/killakill.bat)       | This script kills processes using ports 5000 and 4200 using the taskkill command in Windows cmd. It then notifies the user and waits for their confirmation before exiting. It is very convenient for cleaning Prefect and MlFlow services to run new instances                                            |

| [ModelWrapper.py](https://github.com/FaresAmiar/Airbnb-Price-Prediction/blob/main/workflow_mgmt/ModelWrapper.py)                 | This code defines a ModelWrapper class that extends the mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel class. It wraps a given model and implements a predict method, which uses the wrapped model to make predictions on the input data.                                                                                                                                                                        |

It loads the dataset, preprocesses it, splits it into training and testing sets, transforms it, trains the model, evaluates its performance, and logs the results using MLflow. It also includes functionality for monitoring metrics and potentially triggering model retraining. |
| [model_ops.py](https://github.com/FaresAmiar/Airbnb-Price-Prediction/blob/main/workflow_mgmt/model_ops.py)                       | The code includes two functions: 1. "train_model" to train a machine learning model using specified hyperparameters and log the parameters with MLflow.2. "evaluate_model" to evaluate the trained model's performance using a specified metric function and log the result with MLflow.                                                                                                    |
| [data_ops.py](https://github.com/FaresAmiar/Airbnb-Price-Prediction/blob/main/workflow_mgmt/data_ops.py)                         | The code consists of functions to load a dataset, preprocess it by filling missing values and filtering out certain values, split the dataset into training and test sets, transform the dataset by encoding categorical variables, and extract features and target variables. It utilizes pandas, scikit-learn, and DictVectorizer.                                                        |
| [evidently_monitoring.py](https://github.com/FaresAmiar/Airbnb-Price-Prediction/blob/main/workflow_mgmt/evidently_monitoring.py) | This code includes functions for loading data and models, as well as calculating and generating reports on data drift using the package evidently. It also has a commented-out main function for running the metrics calculation. The code aims to provide analysis and insights on how the model's predictions might change over time.                                                     |

| [api.py](https://github.com/FaresAmiar/Airbnb-Price-Prediction/blob/main/api/api.py) | This code sets up a Flask API that uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict outcomes based on input data. It loads the model and data vectorizer, accepts POST requests with JSON data, transforms the data using the vectorizer, runs it through the model, and returns the predictions as JSON. The API can be accessed at'0.0.0.0:5000/predict' when the code is run. |
